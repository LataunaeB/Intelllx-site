# Email Delivery Delayed - What This Means

## Current Status ✅
- ✅ Lead is being saved to Supabase
- ✅ Resend is attempting to send email from `onboarding@resend.dev` to `hello@intelllx.com`
- ⏳ Email shows "delivery delayed" status

## Why "Delivery Delayed"?

The `onboarding@resend.dev` address has limitations:
1. It's designed for testing, not production
2. May have strict sending limits
3. May only be able to send to verified recipient addresses
4. May have additional delays or blocks

## What You Should Do

### Option 1: Wait for Delivery
"Delivery delayed" doesn't mean "failed" - it means the email is in Resend's queue. It might:
- Deliver eventually (could take hours)
- Or bounce back if `hello@intelllx.com` isn't verified with Resend

### Option 2: Check Your Email Service Provider
Check if `hello@intelllx.com` has any:
- Incoming mail filters
- Spam blocks
- Rate limits

### Option 3: Verify Domain in Resend (Recommended)
To fix this permanently:
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Complete domain verification for `intelllx.com`
3. Once verified, change FROM back to `hello@intelllx.com`
4. Emails will deliver reliably

### Option 4: Use a Different Recipient for Testing
To test if the issue is with `hello@intelllx.com` specifically:
1. Temporarily change `RESEND_TO` in Vercel to a Gmail address
2. Test the form
3. See if Gmail receives the email

## Current Workaround

Your leads ARE being saved to Supabase, so you're not losing data. You can:
1. Check Supabase dashboard for new leads
2. Set up Supabase email notifications
3. Check the Resend dashboard periodically

## Next Steps

The form is working! The only remaining issue is email delivery. This is expected with `onboarding@resend.dev` until your domain is fully verified.
