# ‚úÖ Resend Setup - YOU'RE ALMOST DONE!

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ `intelllx.com` is verified in Resend
- ‚úÖ DNS records are correct at the domain level
- ‚úÖ Code updated to use `hello@intelllx.com`

## What You Need to Do

### Option 1: No Environment Variable Needed (Recommended)
The code now defaults to `hello@intelllx.com` automatically. Just deploy and test!

### Option 2: Set Custom Email Address (Optional)
If you want to send from a different address like `noreply@intelllx.com`:

**In Vercel:**
1. Go to your project settings
2. Environment Variables
3. Add: `RESEND_FROM=noreply@intelllx.com`
4. Redeploy

**In local development (.env.local):**
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
RESEND_FROM=noreply@intelllx.com  # Optional - defaults to hello@intelllx.com
```

## How It Works

Since `intelllx.com` is verified in Resend, you can send from **ANY** email address using that domain:
- ‚úÖ `hello@intelllx.com`
- ‚úÖ `noreply@intelllx.com`
- ‚úÖ `notifications@intelllx.com`
- ‚úÖ `support@intelllx.com`
- ‚ùå `anything@send.intelllx.com` (subdomain not verified)

## Forget About `send.intelllx.com`

That subdomain is NOT needed. The DNS records there don't matter because Resend only sees your verified root domain `intelllx.com`.

## Testing

1. Submit a form on your site
2. Check your email
3. Check Vercel logs for any errors
4. Emails should come from `hello@intelllx.com`

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Check Vercel logs for errors. Common issues:
- Missing `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable
- DNS propagation delay (wait 10-15 minutes after adding domain)
- Rate limits (Resend free tier has limits)

## That's It! üéâ

Your emails will now send from your verified domain. No subdomains needed!
