# Launch UX Polish - QA Checklist

## Overview
This document tracks all UX/UI improvements made to prepare Intelllx.com for production launch. All changes focus on visibility, legibility, accessibility, and professional polish across desktop and mobile.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Header/Navigation Improvements ✅

**What Changed:**
- Header now uses semi-transparent backdrop with blur effect (`bg-white/95 backdrop-blur-md`)
- Added dark mode support for header (`dark:bg-gray-900/95`)
- Improved nav link contrast with proper dark mode colors
- Added visible focus rings to all navigation links
- Enhanced mobile menu focus indicators

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Header.tsx`

**Why:**
- Previous solid white header could clash with hero backgrounds
- Nav links needed better visibility in both light/dark modes
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation now has clear visual indicators

**Test:**
- ✅ Navigate site with Tab key - all links show blue focus rings
- ✅ Open mobile menu, press Tab - focus moves through menu items
- ✅ Press Escape in mobile menu - menu closes and focus returns to hamburger
- ✅ Header remains visible over dark hero background

---

### 2. Form Input Contrast & Accessibility ✅

**What Changed:**
- Improved placeholder text color from `placeholder-gray-400` to `placeholder-gray-300`
- Added `aria-required="true"` to required form fields
- Enhanced select dropdown styling with dark background for options
- All inputs have 2px blue focus rings with proper contrast

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/contact/page.tsx`

**Why:**
- Gray-400 placeholders had insufficient contrast (failed WCAG AA)
- Screen readers needed explicit required field indicators
- Select dropdown options were unreadable on light backgrounds

**Test:**
- ✅ All placeholder text is clearly visible in contact form
- ✅ Select "Service Interest" dropdown - options have dark background
- ✅ Tab through form fields - each shows clear blue focus ring
- ✅ Screen reader announces "required" for name, email, message fields

---

### 3. CTA Button Enhancements ✅

**What Changed:**
- Added `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[color]-400 focus:ring-offset-2` to all CTAs
- Added descriptive `aria-label` attributes to all buttons
- Standardized focus ring colors to match button gradients (blue, purple, orange, emerald, indigo)
- Ensured all buttons meet WCAG AA contrast requirements

**Buttons Updated:**
- Home page: Primary "Get Started" + Secondary "View Pricing"
- Home page: Bottom CTA section buttons
- Pricing page: All 5 pricing card CTAs
- Contact page: "Send Message" button + "View Pricing" quick action

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `src/app/pricing/page.tsx`
- `src/app/contact/page.tsx`

**Why:**
- Keyboard users need clear visual feedback when focusing buttons
- Screen reader users benefit from descriptive labels
- Professional sites must meet WCAG AA standards

**Test:**
- ✅ Tab to any CTA button - visible focus ring appears
- ✅ All button text has sufficient contrast against background
- ✅ Click any pricing CTA - opens Calendly in new tab
- ✅ All buttons work correctly on mobile touch

---

### 4. Link Routing Verification ✅

**What Changed:**
- Verified all navigation links route to correct pages
- Confirmed all pricing CTAs point to `site.calendly` (Calendly booking)
- Ensured all internal links use Next.js `Link` component
- External links have `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security

**Links Verified:**
| Link | Destination | Status |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Home nav link | `/` | ✅ |
| Services nav link | `/services` | ✅ |
| Pricing nav link | `/pricing` | ✅ |
| FAQ nav link | `/faq` | ✅ |
| About nav link | `/about` | ✅ |
| Contact nav link | `/contact` | ✅ |
| Hero "Get Started" | `/contact` | ✅ |
| Hero "View Pricing" | `/pricing` | ✅ |
| All pricing CTAs | Calendly (external) | ✅ |
| Contact "View Pricing" | `/pricing` | ✅ |

**Files Modified:**
- None (verification only)

**Why:**
- Dead links damage credibility and user trust
- Proper routing ensures smooth user experience
- External links need security attributes

**Test:**
- ✅ Click every navigation link - correct page loads
- ✅ Click pricing CTAs - Calendly opens in new tab
- ✅ No 404 errors or broken links
- ✅ Back button works correctly

---

## Responsive Breakpoints

The site should look great at these common viewport sizes:

| Device | Width | Status |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Mobile (Portrait) | 375px | ✅ |
| Mobile (Landscape) | 667px | ✅ |
| Tablet (Portrait) | 768px | ✅ |
| Tablet (Landscape) | 1024px | ✅ |
| Laptop | 1440px | ✅ |
| Desktop | 1920px | ✅ |

---

## Known Non-Issues

These are intentional design choices, not bugs:

1. **Google Fonts Warning**: Occasional "slow filesystem" or connection warnings during build are expected and don't affect production.
2. **Hero Background Pattern**: Subtle dot pattern is low opacity by design.
3. **Button Hover Transform**: Buttons lift slightly on hover - this is intentional microinteraction.
4. **Mobile Menu Animation**: 300ms slide animation may feel instant on fast devices - this is fine.
