# Current Status & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed

1. **TypeScript Errors** - All resolved in `src/app/api/leads/route.ts`
2. **Build** - Code compiles successfully  
3. **Code Quality** - Unused imports removed, error handling improved

## üîç What We Found

### Missing Locally (`.env.local`):
- ‚ùå `SUPABASE_URL`
- ‚ùå `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- ‚ùå `RESEND_API_KEY`
- ‚ùå `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEETINGS_URL`

### Git History Shows:
- ‚úÖ Commits indicate Vercel environment variables WERE configured
- ‚úÖ Resend integration was deployed
- ‚úÖ Supabase integration was deployed

## ü§î What This Means

Your Vercel production environment probably HAS these variables configured. The issue is that your LOCAL `.env.local` file is missing them.

## üéØ Next Steps (Pick One)

### Option 1: Test Production (Recommended)
If you want to see if production is working:
1. Go to https://intelllx.com/contact
2. Submit the form
3. Check if it works in production

### Option 2: Set Up Local Development
If you want to develop locally with full functionality:
1. Get Supabase credentials from: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Get Resend API key from: https://resend.com/api-keys
3. Add them to `.env.local`
4. Run `npm run dev`

### Option 3: Just Deploy & Test
Since Vercel likely has everything configured:
1. Commit your changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Fix TypeScript errors"`
2. Push: `git push origin main`
3. Vercel will auto-deploy
4. Test the contact form on your live site

## üîß What Was the "Bad Request Error"?

Looking at the code, the most likely cause was:
1. Missing Supabase credentials in Vercel (now fixed based on git history)
2. OR Resend API key expired/changed
3. OR Missing Supabase tables (migration not run)

## üìã How to Check If Vercel Has the Right Config

You can check your Vercel environment variables at:
https://vercel.com/dashboard

Navigate to:
1. Your project (`intelllx-site`)
2. Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Should show:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - `RESEND_FROM`
   - `RESEND_TO`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEETINGS_URL`

## üí° Quick Test

Run this to test if your API works:

```bash
curl -X POST https://intelllx.com/api/leads \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","name":"Test User","message":"Test message"}'
```

If it returns `{"ok": true}`, everything is working! ‚úÖ
