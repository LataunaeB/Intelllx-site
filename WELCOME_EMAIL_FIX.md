# ✅ Welcome Email Fix - COMPLETE

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Changed Email Sender to Resend Onboarding Email**
- **Before:** Trying to send from `hello@intelllx.com` (not verified yet)
- **After:** Using `onboarding@resend.dev` (works without domain verification)
- **Location:** Line 190 in `src/app/api/leads/route.ts`

### 2. **Added Zoom Links to All Welcome Emails**
- **Hot Leads:** Now includes Zoom meeting link
- **Warm Leads:** Now includes Zoom meeting link  
- **Cold Leads:** Now includes Zoom meeting link
- **Location:** Lines 308, 334, 360 in `src/app/api/leads/route.ts`

## What Clients Will Receive Now

When someone fills out your contact form, they'll get a welcome email with:

✅ **Calendly Link** - To book a discovery call  
✅ **Zoom Link** - To join the meeting (from `MEETINGS_URL` env var)  
✅ **Personalized Content** - Based on their lead temperature (hot/warm/cold)  
✅ **Lead Score** - Their calculated score out of 100  

## How It Works

1. Client submits contact form
2. System calculates lead score (1-100)
3. System determines temperature:
   - **Hot:** 70-100 points
   - **Warm:** 40-69 points
   - **Cold:** 1-39 points
4. Sends welcome email TO the lead (with Calendly + Zoom links)
5. Sends notification email TO you at hello@intelllx.com

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel:

```bash
# Required
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
RESEND_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev  # Will use this until your domain is verified

# Optional (defaults shown)
RESEND_TO=hello@intelllx.com
MEETINGS_URL=https://us06web.zoom.us/j/8981234567?pwd=abc123
```

## Testing

1. Submit the contact form at https://intelllx.com/contact
2. Check your email at hello@intellaustic.com
3. Check the lead's email (they should get welcome email)
4. Check Vercel logs for any errors

## Once Your Domain is Verified

When `intelllx.com` is fully verified in Resend:

1. Change `RESEND_FROM` to `hello@intelllx.com` in Vercel
2. Redeploy (or it will use your custom domain automatically)

## What's Next?

Test the form and let me know if:
- ✅ Welcome emails are being sent to leads
- ✅ Notification emails are being sent to you
- ❌ If you're still seeing any errors

Check your Vercel logs if there are issues!
