# Email Status Check

## What You Should Check

I need you to check these sources to see what's happening with the emails:

### 1. Check Resend Dashboard
Go to: https://resend.com/emails

Look for:
- Welcome emails sent to your test lead
- Any error messages or delivery failures
- Timestamps to match when you submitted the form

### 2. Check Your Supabase Database
Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard

Navigate to: Table Editor → `leads` table
- Is the lead showing up in the database?
- Check the `welcome_email_sent` field - what does it say?

### 3. Check Your Email Inbox
Check: hello@intelllx.com
- Any emails from onboarding@resend.dev?
- Check spam folder too
- What's the timestamp on any emails you received?

## Expected Behavior

Based on the code:
1. ✅ Lead should be saved to Supabase
2. ✅ Welcome email should be sent to the LEAD (with Calendly + Zoom links)
3. ❓ Notification email should be sent to YOU (hello@intelllx.com)

The notification email (to you) might be failing if:
- `onboarding@resend.dev` can't send to your custom domain
- Your domain isn't fully verified
- There's a rate limit issue

## Quick Fix Options

If the notification to you isn't working, we have these options:

### Option A: Use Gmail address temporarily
Change `RESEND_TO` in Vercel to your personal Gmail to test

### Option B: Skip notification email for now
Since the lead is being saved to Supabase, you can check there

### Option C: Keep checking Resend dashboard
You'll see both emails there even if one doesn't deliver
